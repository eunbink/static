<!-- Student can explain what web semantics are and can apply best practices in their HTML files. -->
<!-- custom: you can customize web semantics by whatever you want to put in html. most general one could be header, body, footer, you can also put article, nav, section as well.  -->
<!-- semantic: it is a html markup. A semantic element describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.  -->
<!-- what's the goal?  developer can organize and format html page better. They can use semantics to divide in to clear clean sections of the page.-->
<!-- what purpose does it serve? By adding semantic tags to html, it provides additional information about each tag. it helps communication.  -->
<!-- best practice: it is best practices for modern websites when you are building html from scratch it helps out the layout and meaning to each tag. I just relized there are so many mark ups that i could use.... i should have used this alot more often!  -->
